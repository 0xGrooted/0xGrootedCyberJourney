# Introduction to Digital Forensics

## Digital Forensics

DF involves the collection, preservation, analysis and presentation of digital evidence to investigate cyber incidents.

_**Key Concepts**:_

* _`Electronic Evidence`: Digital forensics deals with electronic evidence, which can include files, emails, logs, databases, network traffic, and more. This evidence is collected from computers, mobile devices, servers, cloud services, and other digital sources._
* _`Preservation of Evidence`: Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of digital evidence is crucial. Proper procedures are followed to preserve evidence, establish a chain of custody, and prevent any unintentional alterations._
* _`Forensic Process`: The digital forensics process typically involves several stages:_
  * _`Identification`: Determining potential sources of evidence._
  * _`Collection`: Gathering data using forensically sound methods._
  * _`Examination`: Analyzing the collected data for relevant information._
  * _`Analysis`: Interpreting the data to draw conclusions about the incident._
  * _`Presentation`: Presenting findings in a clear and comprehensible manner._
* _`Types of Cases`: Digital forensics is applied in a variety of cases, including:_
  * _Cybercrime investigations (hacking, fraud, data theft)._
  * _Intellectual property theft._
  * _Employee misconduct investigations._
  * _Data breaches and incidents affecting organizations._
  * _Litigation support in legal proceedings._

_The basic steps for performing a forensic investigation are as follows:_

1. _`Create a Forensic Image`_
2. _`Document the System's State`_
3. _`Identify and Preserve Evidence`_
4. _`Analyze the Evidence`_
5. _`Timeline Analysis`_
6. _`Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)`_
7. _`Report and Documentation`_

## Windows Forensics Overview

NTFS (New Technology File System) - proprietary file system developed by Microsoft.

* `File Metadata`: NTFS stores extensive metadata for each file, including creation time, modification time, access time, and attribute information (such as read-only, hidden, or system file attributes). Analysing these timestamps can help establish timelines and reconstruct user activities.
* `MFT Entries`: The Master File Table (MFT) is a crucial component of NTFS that stores metadata for all files and directories on a volume. Examining MFT entries provides insights into file names, sizes, timestamps, and data storage locations. When files are deleted, their MFT entries are marked as available, but the data may remain on the disk until overwritten.
* `File Slack and Unallocated Space`: Unallocated space on an NTFS volume may contain remnants of deleted files or fragments of data. File slack refers to the unused portion of a cluster that may contain data from a previous file. Digital forensic tools can help recover and analyse data from these areas.
* `File Signatures`: File headers and signatures can be useful in identifying file types even when file extensions have been changed or obscured. This information is critical for reconstructing the types of files present on a system.
* `USN Journal`: The Update Sequence Number (USN) Journal is a log maintained by NTFS to record changes made to files and directories. Forensic investigators can analyse the USN Journal to track file modifications, deletions, and renames.
* `LNK Files`: Windows shortcut files (LNK files) contain information about the target file or program, as well as timestamps and metadata. These files can provide insights into recently accessed files or executed programs.
* `Prefetch Files`: Prefetch files are generated by Windows to improve the start up performance of applications. These files can indicate which programs have been run on the system and when they were last executed.
* `Registry Hives`: While not directly related to the file system, Windows Registry hives contain important configuration and system information. Malicious activities or unauthorized changes can leave traces in the registry, which forensic investigators analyse to understand system modifications.
* `Shellbags`: Shellbags are registry entries that store folder view settings, such as window positions and sorting preferences. Analysing shellbags can reveal user navigation patterns and potentially identify accessed folders.
* `Thumbnail Cache`: Thumbnail caches store miniature previews of images and documents. These caches can reveal files that were recently viewed, even if the original files have been deleted.
* `Recycle Bin`: The Recycle Bin contains files that have been deleted from the file system. Analysing the Recycle Bin can help recover deleted files and provide insights into user actions.
* `Alternate Data Streams (ADS)`: ADS are additional streams of data associated with files. Malicious actors may use ADS to hide data, and forensic investigators need to examine these streams to ensure a comprehensive analysis.
* `Volume Shadow Copies`: NTFS supports Volume Shadow Copies, which are snapshots of the file system at different points in time. These copies can be valuable for data recovery and analysis of changes made over time.
* `Security Descriptors and ACLs`: Access Control Lists (ACLs) and security descriptors determine file and folder permissions. Analysing these artefacts helps understand user access rights and potential security breaches.

### Windows Event Logs

Windows Event Logs - An intrinsic part of the windows operating system, storing logs from different operators.
